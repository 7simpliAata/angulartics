The book is divided into six parts, covering topics such as globalization and international business, cross-cultural business, country market assessment, exporting and global sourcing, global marketing and R&D, and global human resource management. Each chapter features learning objectives, key terms, real-world examples, case studies, discussion questions, exercises and online resources. The book also includes access to MyManagementLab, an online platform that provides students with interactive learning tools and assessments.
 
The authors of the book are experts in the field of international business, with extensive academic and professional experience. S. Cavusgil is a professor of international business at Georgia State University and the director of the Center for International Business Education and Research. Gary Knight is a professor of global management at Willamette University and a distinguished visiting professor at INCAE Business School in Costa Rica. John Riesenberger is an adjunct professor of international business at Pepperdine University and a consultant for multinational corporations.
 
The book is well-written, comprehensive and up-to-date, reflecting the latest trends and developments in international business. The book also engages students with its millennial-oriented approach, using technology, multimedia and social media to enhance learning outcomes. The book is suitable for undergraduate and graduate courses in international business, as well as for professionals who want to update their knowledge and skills in this dynamic field.
  
One of the strengths of the book is its global perspective, which covers both developed and emerging markets, as well as regional and cultural differences. The book also emphasizes the importance of ethics, social responsibility and sustainability in international business, as well as the role of innovation and entrepreneurship. The book provides students with a balanced and realistic view of the opportunities and challenges of doing business across borders.
 
Another strength of the book is its pedagogical features, which help students to apply the concepts and theories to real-world situations. The book uses a variety of examples and cases from different industries, countries and regions, such as Starbucks, Alibaba, IKEA, Samsung, Brazil, India, China and Africa. The book also encourages students to develop their critical thinking, analytical and communication skills through discussion questions, exercises and online resources.
 
The book is not without its limitations, however. One of the limitations is that some of the topics and issues may become outdated or irrelevant in the fast-changing global environment. For example, the book does not cover the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on international business, which has been a major disruption and challenge for many companies and countries. Another limitation is that some of the chapters may be too long or complex for some students, especially those who are new to international business or have limited background knowledge.
