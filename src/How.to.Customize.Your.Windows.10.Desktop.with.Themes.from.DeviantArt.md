## What are Windows 10 Themes?
 
A Windows 10 theme is a collection of settings that changes the appearance of your desktop, such as the background, colors, sounds, and cursor. You can apply a theme to your desktop by going to Settings > Personalization > Themes and choosing one from the list. Windows 10 comes with some built-in themes, such as Windows (light), Windows (dark), Flowers, and Landscapes. You can also download more themes from the Microsoft Store or from other sources.
 
## Why Use Themes from DeviantArt?

Unlike the official themes from Microsoft, which are mostly based on photos and colors, themes from DeviantArt often feature custom designs, icons, fonts, and sounds that can transform your desktop into a unique and personalized space. Some of the themes are inspired by popular movies, games, anime, or comics, while others are original creations that showcase the artist's imagination and skills.
