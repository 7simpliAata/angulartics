 Here is what I came up with:  
One of the unique features of Puri Sharma Kalia PDF download is that it includes a chapter on bioinorganic chemistry, which is an emerging and interdisciplinary field of study. Bioinorganic chemistry deals with the role of metal ions and metal complexes in biological systems, such as enzymes, proteins, DNA, RNA and metalloproteins. The book explains the principles and applications of bioinorganic chemistry in a simple and interesting way.
 
Another feature of Puri Sharma Kalia PDF download is that it contains a chapter on organometallic compounds, which are compounds that contain metal-carbon bonds. Organometallic compounds are widely used as catalysts, reagents and intermediates in organic synthesis and industrial processes. The book provides a comprehensive and systematic coverage of the synthesis, structure, bonding, reactivity and properties of organometallic compounds.
 
Puri Sharma Kalia PDF download also contains a chapter on nanomaterials, which are materials that have dimensions in the nanometer range. Nanomaterials have unique physical, chemical and biological properties that differ from those of bulk materials. The book introduces the concepts and methods of nanoscience and nanotechnology, and discusses the synthesis, characterization and applications of various types of nanomaterials, such as nanoparticles, nanotubes, nanowires, nanorods and nanosheets.
